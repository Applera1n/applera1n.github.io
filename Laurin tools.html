        <p>iCloud is a cloud storage and computing service that was launched by Apple Inc. in 2011. It allows users to store their data on remote servers and access it from any device with an internet connection. iCloud is a secure service that uses various encryption methods to protect users' data from unauthorized access. One of the most important security features of iCloud is the activation lock. This feature is designed to prevent unauthorized use of a lost or stolen device.</p>
        <p>iCloud activation lock is a security feature that is enabled on Apple devices that run on iOS 7 or later. When an activation lock is enabled, it requires the user to enter their Apple ID and password before they can activate or use the device. This prevents anyone who does not know the owner's Apple ID and password from accessing the device.</p>
        <p>However, there are instances where users forget their Apple ID and password or purchase a second-hand device that is still locked to the previous owner's iCloud account. In such cases, users may attempt to bypass the iCloud activation lock. Bypassing the activation lock is not recommended, as it is illegal and can lead to serious consequences. It is always best to seek the help of Apple or an authorized service provider to unlock the device.</p>

            <p>There are several methods that people use to bypass iCloud activation lock. Some of these methods include using software that claims to bypass iCloud activation lock or using methods that involve changing the device's hardware. However, it is important to note that these methods are illegal and can result in the device becoming permanently locked or unusable.</p>
            <p>Another method used to bypass iCloud activation lock is DNS bypassing. DNS (Domain Name System) bypassing involves changing the DNS settings on the device to redirect it to a different server. This method is temporary and can be used to access certain features of the device, but it does not fully unlock the device. The device will still be locked to the previous owner's iCloud account.</p>
            <p>The best and legal method to bypass iCloud activation lock is to contact Apple or an authorized service provider. These professionals have the knowledge and tools necessary to help unlock the device. If the device was purchased second-hand, the new owner
